Digital Intrusion is a captivating 2D platformer game created by a team of six first-year IT engineering students at ESPRIT. Our project stood out as one of the top 15 at ESPRIT's BAL DES PROJETS. Developed using C and SDL 1.2, the game offers stunning graphics and smooth mechanics across three unique levels.

In this adventure, a hacker has breached the schoolâ€™s local server, causing everyone to disappear into their computers. As the protagonist, you must dive into this digital realm and defeat the hacker to restore order.

Digital Intrusion also includes:

* Login and signup with a profile system.
* A multiplayer mode with a distinct gameplay experience.
* Two characters to choose from.
* Beautiful music and immersive sound effects.

Additionally, we developed an Arduino controller to enhance the gaming experience and to showcase our ability to integrate hardware and software.
